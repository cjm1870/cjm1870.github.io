Introduction to Computer Science
	
					Field Report
	
Information technology is referred to as the use of computers to manipulate, study, send, and receive information. It is commonly abbreviated to IT, which is a very common term in the business world with many businesses needing IT people to make sure everything is running smoothly. The next two things I will be describing are commonly confused with each other but there are a few things that distinguish them. Software engineering is his use of coding and engineering of programs to further advance the software in a systematic way, and make it so that it runs smoothly on computer systems. Computer Science encompasses the same idea on a broader level covering more topics such as, theory, algorithms, languages, and architecture of computer systems. Software engineering is just one facet inside the study of computer science.
	
	One of the jobs that applies computer science is a web developer, a web developer’s design, create websites, and make sure they are running smoothly at any capacity and make sure it is a clean and enjoyable use for all. Web developers use Computer Science when they apply the use of HTML and CSS to their works to improve the performance and style of their websites. Another job that uses Computer Science heavily would be software developers, who use java, python, swift, and many other languages to create computer programs, apps, and games that influence our daily lives and help us with tasks that we would not know how to solve without. The last career I will be talking about may be the most important of the three and that is information security analysis. This job is important with the increase in cyber terrorists trying to get to your company’s core and stealing information and money. They use extreme coding expertise to fight off all attacks and help business go on with a sound mind knowing their company is in safe hands.
	
	The career I would most enjoy reaching with the use of Computer Science would have to be a computer programmer in Silicon Valley, specifically for the company twitch. I am huge into gaming and I enjoy what Twitch does for the gaming community bringing together viewers with professional or casual streamers to their favorite games. I would like to help Twitch further their business and help with ideas that would keep pushing them in the right direction. I think that working at Twitch would be my dream job and I truly hope one day I will be able to achieve."
